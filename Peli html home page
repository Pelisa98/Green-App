        <p style="color: navajowhite">
            Gathering, analyzing, and reusing items that would otherwise be thrown away as garbage is the process of recycling.
           It is essential for managing the planet's limited resources since it lessens the need for extracting raw materials,
           conserves energy, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. We can reduce the amount of waste that is transported to 
           landfills and incinerators by recycling things like paper, plastic, glass, and metals. 
           This would lessen environmental damage and promote a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy. 
           Recycling fosters employment growth and green technology innovation in addition to assisting in the safeguarding 
           of environments and biodiversity.
